The keys to achieving a good diet are:
- learning which things are highly nutritious, e.g., wild rice, avocados, bison meat, etc.
- having a repertoire of good, nutritious foods that are easily accessible
- finding places where you can buy high quality food/ingredients that are free of impurities as much as possible (e.g., grass-fed beef & grass-fed milk, farmed salmon in certain countries like New Zealand); buying in bulk gives a great discount
- learning how to cook and/or finding places where you can easily buy high quality meals that use clean ingredients; the latter breaks your wallet
