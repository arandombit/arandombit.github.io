In the same way text has become dense and laden with meaning, so too the videos of the future will contain such creations that will require a hermeneutic zeal to untangle. Only this time the process will be faster. We'll not need thousands of years to reach the pinnacle of semantic density as we now have it in text, for we will have that very same text bootstrap our cognition so as to not start fully anew. A new form of expression that we'll impregnate with deep meaning, a compression of information to be decoded by its viewers to assimilate cultural and worldly knowledge. The Bible of the future will be in video, with maybe some text at its periphery.
